[[file:images/loopy.png]]


* WARNING!
This package is still in beta.  Breaking changes may occur without
warning until the release of version *1.0.0*.

* About
  This package implements interactive completion for the loop facility
  in Common Lisp and Elisp, and adds an appropriate menu entry to
  ~emacs-lisp-mode~ and ~lisp-mode~.

  This package requires no additional setup to work.  The primary
  interactive function (~loopy-insert~) is autoloaded.  By default it is
  *not* bound to any key, but automatically added to the menus
  Emacs-Lisp (in ~emacs-lisp-mode~) and Lisp (in ~lisp-mode~) once loaded.

  loopy defines the following insertion commands:
  * ~loopy-insert~: The primary command defined by this package.
  * ~loopy-add-clause~: Adds a single clause to an existing loop.

  It also offers the following Custom variables (which see):
  * ~loopy-offer-type-specifiers~
  * ~loopy-allow-destructuring~
  * ~loopy-enter-recursive-edit~

  Each variable may also be toggled interactively by corresponding
  commands.
  * ~loopy-toggle-type-specifiers~
  * ~loopy-toggle-recursive-editing~
  * ~loopy-toggle-destructuring~
